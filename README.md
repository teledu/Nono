# Nonogram solver

The project was created as an attempt to automate solving nonograms. Some example inputs are provided int the BoardBuilder.cs file. 

The project can solve most of the nonograms where there is no need for guessing which of the possible options is correct and then verifying if it is possible.

The implementation is something that I came up with based on my findings and experience gained while solving nonograms. It might not be the best solution, but it seems to work with at least the inputs tested. The only UI currently is a console output, the only input supported is hardcoding it. However the solver engine can be reused in any application/UI.
